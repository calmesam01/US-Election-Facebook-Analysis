# US-Election-Facebook-Analysis
<b>Analysing number of likes on facebook posts of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in the election week using Rfacebook package.</b>

This package allow R programers to access Facebook's API to get information about public pages, groups, and posts, as well as some of the authenticated user's private data.

The code plots the number of likes on the official facebook pages of the the US Election 2016 candidates in the election week (since='2015/11/06', until='2015/11/12').

1. First go to https://developers.facebook.com/tools to get access token which gets expired after every 90 minutes.
2. Then go to the code at  and paste the token there.
3. Run the code in RStudio and see the difference.

What we analyse is that even though Trump is not liked much by Americans but his posts get more likes than their favourite Clinton.

Immediately after trump's triump, Obama's likes droped exponentially.
